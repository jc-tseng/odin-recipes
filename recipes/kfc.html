    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Marinade:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken thighs, quartered</li>
        <li>½ yellow onion, grated</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon fine salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Batter:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>¾ cup cornstarch</li>
        <li>½ cup self-rising flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup very cold water, or as needed</li>
        <li>oil, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir chicken, onion, garlic, fine salt, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper together in a bowl until chicken is coated. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 4 hours to overnight.</li>

        <li>Increase oil temperature in the deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Working in batches, cook chicken again in hot oil until golden brown and crispy on the outside, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to drain.</li>
